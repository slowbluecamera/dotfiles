reminder (because I forget)

dotfiles are managed with "yadm"

yadm is installed on mac using homebrew ("brew install yadm")

Check for updates using standard git commands:

    yadm status - see what has changed
    yadm add - add file to commit group
    yadm commit -m
    yadm push
    etc.
    etc.
